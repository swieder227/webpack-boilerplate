# A WIP Boilerplate for static HTML and Webpack build process

### Dev Build

- Files are in ./src
- Dev server webpack-dev-server compiles __in memory__ and does not save to disk
- A sourcemap makes bundle debugging available under DevTools > Source Panel > webpack://.src/js/**

        # Starts webpack-dev-server at http://localhost:8080 with hotloading
        # Watches src files for changes then recompiles
        $ npm run dev


Update Package.json (name, desc, author)
run npm install
run npm start
